        <h1>My perfect trip to Canada</h1>
        <p>Canada is a country in North America. Its ten provinces and <br> three territories extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean,<br> covering over 9.98 million square kilometres, making it the world's second-largest country<br> by total area.</p>
        <p> Canada was formed as a federal dominion of four provinces.<br> This began an accretion of provinces and territories and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom.<br> This widening autonomy was highlighted by the Statute of Westminster 1931 and culminated in the Canada Act 1982,<br> which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the Parliament of the United Kingdom.</p>

        <h2>Animal I would Like to See</h2>

            <li>Polar Bear</li>
       
       <p> The polar bear is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses.<br> It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore.</p>

        <li>Canada goose</li>
       <p> A large brown goose with a black neck and white chinstrap. Overall size, bill size, and brown coloration variable across subspecies.<br> Occurs in any open or wetland habitat, from city parks and golf courses to pristine marshes and Arctic tundra.<br> Typically in flocks or family groups. Often seen in mixed flocks with Cackling Goose, especially in central and western North America.<br> Canada Goose is almost always larger, longer-necked, and longer-billed than Cackling, although beware there is some overlap between the smallest Canada and largest Cackling.<br> Abundant and widespread throughout the U.S. and Canada; rare in Mexico. Introduced and widely established in Europe.<br> Listen for loud honking calls, especially as flocks migrate overhead in the classic V formation.</p>

        <h2>And food I Will like to Eat...</h2>
       <p> Poutine is a dish of french fries and cheese curds topped with a brown gravy. It emerged in Quebec,<br> in the late 1950s in the Centre-du-Qu√©bec region, though its exact origins are uncertain and there are several competing claims regarding its invention.</p>
